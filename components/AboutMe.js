        <h2>
          Looking back at my time at BCIT, I&apos;ve found myself characterizing the experience as a love/hate relationship. During the program, we we&apos;re treated not as students but as workers. Numerous deadlines all converging upon eachother had me ripping my hair out, but had developed in me the qualities of tenacity and grit needed to become a Software Developer that can always get the job done. Looking back, I&apos;m glad to have done the program and I believe I am a better Software Developer having completed it.
